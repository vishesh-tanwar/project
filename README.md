Hello World ,
This is my project called Campus voice Hub .
The web application is designed to facilitate efficient grievance handling for students, faculty,and staff.
Administrators have the ability to view and address grievances promptly.
Users can maintain detailed profiles of their registered grievances.
Users receive email updates on the statuses of their grievances.
The platform ensures transparency and accountability in the grievance resolution process.
